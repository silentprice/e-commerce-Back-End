# e-commerce-Back-End

## Description
 * First I cloned the starter code into the repo to see what I was working with. Then I ran npm i to install all the dependencies given in the start code. After I put my schema into the my workbench and ran the seeded data. Then I made sure my workbench and sequelize were properly synced together. Lastly I worked in Insomnia to test all my routes to make sure they were working properly to successfully run the data, by creating updating and deleting new material.
